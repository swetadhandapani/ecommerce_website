**MERN Stack Online Storefront**

**The MERN Stack Online Storefront project is a full-stack e-commerce
web application built using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It
provides small-to-medium-sized businesses with a scalable and
user-friendly platform for online transactions. Customers can browse
products, manage shopping carts, and complete secure payments via an
integrated gateway, while features like user authentication, product
categorization, real-time inventory tracking, and order management
enhance functionality. Business owners benefit from an admin panel for
inventory control, order processing, and sales analytics. The
application integrates a responsive React frontend with a Node.js and
Express.js backend, using MongoDB for data storage and RESTful APIs for
seamless communication. Security is prioritized with JWT authentication,
secure payment handling, and protections against vulnerabilities. This
project highlights the MERN stack\'s capabilities in creating scalable
web solutions and establishes a solid foundation for future advancements
and potential commercialization.**

**METHODOLOGY**

**a. System Architecture:**

The application is divided into three layers:

1\. **Frontend:** Developed with React to provide a dynamic,
interactive, and responsive user interface.

2\. **Backend:** Built using Node.js and Express.js to manage APIs,
business logic, and server-side functionality.

3\. **Database:** MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database for scalable and
flexible data storage.

**b. Development Workflow:**

1\. **Frontend Development:** Created user interfaces for browsing, cart
management, and checkout using React and styled with CSS and Bootstrap.

2\. **Backend API Design:** Developed RESTful APIs to handle operations
like product retrieval, order management, and authentication.

3\. **Database Design:** Created MongoDB schemas for products, users,
and orders using Mongoose.

4\. **Integration:** Connected frontend and backend components via
RESTful APIs, ensuring smooth data flow and dynamic updates.

5\. **Security Implementation:** Secured data with JWT authentication,
HTTPS, and Stripe payment gateway integration.

**BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION**

**1. Routes:**

Routes define API endpoints for handling client requests:

-   **User Routes:**

    -   \`/api/users/login\` for authentication

    -   \`/api/users/register\` for account creation

-   **Product Routes:**

    -   \`/api/products\` to fetch product lists

    -   \`/api/products/:id\` for specific product details

-   **Order Routes:**

    -   \`/api/orders\` to place orders

    -   \`/api/orders/:id\` for order tracking

**2. Models:**

Models define the data structure in MongoDB:

-   **User Model:** Stores user details (\`name\`, \`email\`,
    \`password\`, \`role\`) with encrypted passwords.

-   **Product Model:** Manages product information (\`name\`, \`price\`,
    \`category\`, \`stock\`, \`description\`).

-   **Order Model:** Tracks order data (\`userId\`, \`items\`,
    \`totalPrice\`, \`status\`).

**3. Controllers:**

Controllers handle business logic:

-   **User Controller:** Functions like \`registerUser()\` for new
    accounts, \`loginUser()\` for authentication.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Product Controller:** Includes \`getProducts()\` for product
    retrieval, \`getProductById()\` for details.

-   **Order Controller:** Manages \`createOrder()\` and
    \`getOrderById()\` for order workflows.

**Frontend Implementation:**

The React-based frontend ensures responsiveness and a dynamic user
experience:

1.  **Product Pages**: Display product lists with search and filter
    options.

2.  **Shopping Cart**: Tracks selected items dynamically.

3.  **Authentication**: Forms for login and registration.

4.  **Admin Dashboard**: Separate views for managing inventory, orders,
    and analytics.

5.  **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap ensures seamless functionality
    across devices.

6.  **State Management**: React\'s context API for managing global
    states like user sessions and cart data.

7.  **APIs**: Fetch data from backend routes using axios.

8.  **Form Validation**: Error handling for user inputs like login
    credentials and order details.

**RESULTS**

The project successfully delivered a functional e-commerce application
with:

1\. Responsive product browsing and search features.

2\. Secure user authentication and checkout processes.
